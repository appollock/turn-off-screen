# Turn off screen
A minimalist tool for those who doesn't have built-in functional button responsible for turning off the screen. Simply download **TurnOffScreen.cmd** file and run it without admin privileges. To bring backlight back simply move the coursor with any pointing device (touchpad/mouse/gamepad/winapi call).
